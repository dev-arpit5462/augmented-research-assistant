Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include:

- Speech recognition
- Learning
- Planning
- Problem solving

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Learns from input-output pairs
   - Examples: Classification, Regression

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Uses unlabeled data
   - Finds hidden patterns
   - Examples: Clustering, Association

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learns through interaction with environment
   - Uses rewards and penalties
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics

Applications of AI and ML:
- Healthcare: Diagnosis, drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading
- Transportation: Autonomous vehicles
- Technology: Recommendation systems, search engines
- Manufacturing: Quality control, predictive maintenance
